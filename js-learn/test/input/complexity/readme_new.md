Overview
========

`Strider` is an Open Source Continuous Deployment / Continuous Integration
platform. It is written in Node.JS / JavaScript and uses MongoDB as a backing
store. It is published under the BSD license.

`Strider` is conceptually similar to Travis-CI or Jenkins with the following
major differences:

* A focus on Continuous Deployment rather than just Continuous Integration
* Designed to be easy to install & setup
* Deployable & usable on Heroku free plan
* Intended for deployment on private infrastructure
* An emphasis on extensibility
* Out-of-the-box support for Node.JS projects and Selenium/Sauce Labs tests
* Support for Python/Django, Ruby/Rails and more coming soon in form of extensions
* Commercial support, consulting & hosting available


Running on Heroku
=================

`Strider` can be deployed to Heroku easily, with minimal configuration, using a
free MongoDB database add-on from MongoLab and a free SMTP server add-on from
SendGrid or MailGun.

- Register for a free Heroku account at http://heroku.com
- Install the Heroku toolbelt on your machine from https://toolbelt.heroku.com
- Clone this repository:
  `git clone https://github.com/Strider-CD/strider.git`
- `cd` into the clone and log into Heroku:
    `heroku login`
- Create a new Heroku app for Strider:
    `heroku create`
- Edit `config.js` and set the following values:
  - Server name. Address at which server will be accessible on the Internet. E.g. https://mystrider.herokuapp.com/
  - Github app id & secret for your Heroku app - you can register a new one 
  at https://github.com/settings/applications/new - the Main URL should be the same as server name above,
  and the callback URL should be server name with the path /auth/github/callback.
  E.g. https://mystrider.herokuapp.com/auth/github/callback
- Commit the `config.js` changes locally:
    `git commit -m'add my config' config.js`
- Provision a free MongoDB database:
    `heroku addons:add mongolab:starter`
- Provision a free SendGrid SMTP server:
    `heroku addons:add sendgrid:starter`
- Deploy Strider:
    `git push heroku master`
- Add an initial (admin) user:
    `heroku run bin/node bin/strider adduser`
- Your personal Strider instance is now running on the Internet! Visit it and log in with the email & password you just created an account for.

Running on Infrastructure
=========================

Make sure you have MongoDB installed on your system. You can get the latest version at
http://www.mongodb.org/downloads

Next you will need Node.JS. You can get binary packages for most platforms at
http://nodejs.org

Once you have Node.JS on your system, you can fetch & install all the dependencies for Strider
by executing::

    npm install


Configuring
===========

`Strider` configuration is stored in the `config.js` file. Most of the default
values should work fine for running on localhost, however for an
Internet-accessible deployment the following values will need to be configured:

- In `config.js` file you'll need to set:

  - MongoDB DB URI if not localhost (you can safely use MongoLab free plan - works great)
  - Server name. Address at which server will be accessible on the Internet. E.g. https://strider.example.com/
  - Github app id & secret (assuming not running on localhost:3000) - you can register a new one 
  at https://github.com/settings/applications/new - the Main URL should be the same as server name above,
  and the callback URL should be server name with the path /auth/github/callback.
  E.g. https://strider.example.com/auth/github/callback
  - Sendgrid credentials (for SMTP - free account is fine). Soon you will be able to specify any SMTP server, not just Sendgrid.

Adding Initial Admin User
=========================

`Strider` isn't much use without an account to login with. Once you create an administrative user, you can invite as many
other people as you like to your instance. There is a simple CLI subcommand to help you create the initial user:

    node bin/strider adduser

Example run:

```bash
$ node bin/strider adduser
Enter email []: strider@example.com
Is admin? (y/n) [n]: y
Enter password []: *******

Email:		strider@example.com
Password:	****
isAdmin:	true
OK? (y/n) [y]:
22 Oct 21:21:01 - info: Connecting to MongoDB URL: mongodb://localhost/strider-foss
22 Oct 21:21:01 - info: User added successfully! Enjoy.
```


Starting Strider
================

Once `Strider` has been installed and configured, it can be started with:

    node bin/strider

Tests
=====

`Strider` tests live in the `test` subdirectory. They are written using `should.js`
BDD-style and utilize the Mocha test framework and `sinon.js` test library.

http://sinonjs.org

To start the tests, just run::

    npm test
